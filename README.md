### Prerequisites

To run the game, you need a web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to control a falling block and prevent it from reaching the bottom of the game container. The block falls continuously from the top of the container, and your task is to move the block left or right to avoid obstacles and keep it from touching the bottom.

Use the left and right arrow keys to move the block horizontally. The block will wrap around to the opposite side when reaching the edge of the container.
